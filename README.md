# Bravo Group ExpenseTracker Application
### Project Overview:
Our customer is requesting for an Expense Tracker desktop application such that end-users can
log their daily/weekly/monthly/annual income and expenses; and the application will report a
summary of their finances, expenditure, etc. In addition to other core features of this application,
there MUST be a window where end-users can add their income and expense items, a window
which MUST visually display and categorize user expenses (e.g. Food, Rent, Entertainment, etc.),
a window which MUST display the monthly review of a user with respect to the total income,
expenses, remaining balance, etc. Moreover, there MUST be functionalities to edit and delete user
entries, when and where necessary. Also, there MUST be an Administrative window where
an administrator can login to view and/or edit user entries, generate a minimal and/or detailed
(individual) report with respect to each user of this application. Also, the administrator MUST
be able to view a minimal and/or detailed (combined) report with reference to all users of the
application, view a list of all registered users and their respective user roles in the application, etc.

The aim of this software project is to create a fully functional application using modern desk-
top or web-development technologies. This project will showcase the students’ skills, projects,
achievements, teamwork, etc.; thereby providing potential employers or clients with an overview
of the students’ expertise.
